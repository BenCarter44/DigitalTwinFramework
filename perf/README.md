# Performance harnesses

## `bench_insitu.py` — in-situ inference latency

The harness behind the compute-placement decision: one no-op asyncflow
function task per call, awaited sequentially (the shape of an in-situ
prediction), plus a 50-way concurrency probe.

```sh
# against the integration stack (test/integration/conftest.py starts one)
python perf/bench_insitu.py both \
    --broker https://127.0.0.1:8031 --endpoint dt_test_task_ep
```

Three configurations matter, and only one of them is a client-side knob:

| path                                            | measured (loopback) |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| in-process `ProcessPoolExecutor`                 | ~11 ms p50, ~35 tasks/s concurrent |
| orbit, `batch_window=0`, notify window 0.25 s    | ~260 ms p50 |
| orbit, `batch_window=0`, notify window 0         | ~19 ms p50, ~334 tasks/s concurrent |

`batch_window=0` is hardcoded in the harness (and in the service's
engines).  The **notify window is an endpoint setting** — start the
endpoint with `RADICAL_ORBIT_RHAPSODY_NOTIFY_WINDOW=0` for the fast row
and leave it at its 0.25 s default to reproduce the slow one.

Routing all user compute through the Rhapsody abstraction therefore
costs single-digit milliseconds per sequential prediction and wins by an
order of magnitude under concurrency.

## `streaming_learner_perf.py`, `plot_streaming_perf.py`

Throughput of the streaming active learner (ROSE); unrelated to the
service path.
